# What is Python?
    # Dynamic programming language
    # High Level Programming Language
        # Trivia: Python was written in C
        # Trivia: Invented in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.
    # List of websites taht use python for some or all of their backend
        # YouTube, Dropbox, Google, instagram, spotify, reddit, Pintrest

# Why Use Python?
    # Libraries
        # TONS of resources and functionalities to accomplish different things
    # Readability
        # Fairly close to english
    # Open Source (free)
    # Community
        # TONS of devs and contributors
    # Scope
        # Python is heavily used in many industries
        # Scientific computing, machine learning, dazta analytics
        # game creation (pygame)
        # web development
        # test automation
        # AI      

# Variables
    # Container / Stores data

hello = "hello"

# Naming Conventions in Python is snake case
    # snake case is all lowercase words separated by underscore

first_name = "Chris"
last_name = "Engel"
age = 28

# variable names need to describe the date the variable holds

# Data Types

# Primitive Types
    # Integers 
        12345
    # Strings 
        "hello it's me"
    # Booleans
        True or False
    # Floats 
        2.5, 42.8

# Composite Types
    # List (same as JS arrays)
        # good practice is to have all data in a list be the same data type, but it doesn't HAVE to be
        [23, "wow so cool"]
        [20, 25, 30, [1, 2, 3], 35]
    # Tuples
        # a list with () instead of [] 
        # Once made CANNOT be changed.
        (23, "wow so cool")
    # Dictionaries (same as JS objects)
        # Key / Value pairs
        #  ALL KEYS ARE STRINGS
            # ints and tuples can be keys but more rare
